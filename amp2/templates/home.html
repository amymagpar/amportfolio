          <p>
          I enjoy streamlining processes, fostering inclusive collaboration, engaging teams in problem-solving, and setting a vision for sustainability and customer success.
          </p>
          <p>
          At <em>Cisco</em> and <em>Meraki</em>, I optimized workflows by removing inefficiencies, introduced automation tools to remove underperforming pages, gave an AI primer to educate teams on AI, added design oversight to asana templates, and created a documentation process for design and UX. 
          <p>
          </p>
          With expertise in budgeting and contract negotiation, shaped by hiring agencies and running my own company, I get better results from budgets. I used go-to-market strategies to launch <em>Sparkle Labs’</em> electronics kits and established governance frameworks for design systems and ADA compliance. I enjoy inspiring my team to think outside the box by holding hackathons, creating career paths, and mentoring.
