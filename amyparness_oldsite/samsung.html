                The homepage needed to show top products and cement Samsung as an innovator in the tech industry. We used a mix of product promos focusing on their technical differentiators in the marketplace and innovation coming out of the Samsung Labs.
              </p>
              <p>We recommended a TV guide which was implemented. </p>

              <p>
                Most people go to Samsung to learn more about new products or get support for products they already own.  During the research phase, we saw customers had trouble finding things like products,
                documentation and could not tell products apart. We saw opportunities to make the product details pages more
                visual in place of text details or scrolling all the way down the page. We changed the product photos to show a side view, what's in the box and back ports. Top features would have icons at the top of the page.
                <h3> Support in the PDP </h3>
                <p>
                  Support was incorporated into the product pages instead of having the customer click away from the product page. We added product specific support documents, view technical specs and support guides and the ability to contact support
                  Based on search results and customer service reports, the top requests from customers around support were provided instead of having to download a file from a support section.</p>

            <p>
              We presented several ideas of how they could innovate.
              The shopping cart allowed customers to save things to the cart without adding them into the actual cart to view cost of adding compatible products. We also recommend sets like "Home Theater" that came bundles with
              a TV and sound system.  </p>
            <p>
              We presented a compare feature for TVs and mobile since these are products that have similar models and customers need help choosing the right model. This was implemented on Samsung.com.
