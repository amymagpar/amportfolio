              The Talk2Me was a project made in graduate school by my partner at Sparkle Labs, Ariel Churi. It was originally a
              single motor tickler and vibrations were based on the an audio input.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating, we began researching the industry and saw a market opportunity to design a hi-end dual motor vibrator. We did user testing with some prototypes and decided it had to be wireless.
              We wrote a business plan and began the process of seeking funding. We sourced factories and built some strong partnerships in the adult industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a sensation at the AVN in 2007. In the end, we only got a handful of working prototypes and their quality was not where we wanted them to be. We had made a wrong sourcing decision.
              We would still love to release this vibe as it is timeless and got so much right.

              We went through around 28 different 3D rendered designs. We prototyped some of the ones we thought would fill a gap in the marketplace with clay.

              The branding and design was built around competing in the high-end luxury category since the Talk2Me would cost around $150.
              We experimented with different packaging styles and layouts.  Infographics were used to explain how the vibe worked.

            <p>
              The Talk2Me was one of the first modern audio vibrators. It was inspired by the popularity of the iPod and growing cell phone use. The idea was to bring people closer together even when they are far away.
              Talk2Me came with a visual manual with ideas of how to use it and explaining the controls.
