      <h1>Elevating sustainability through design system innovation</h1>
      <p>
        To support Cisco's environmental commitments,Â RFPs, and advance the
        circular economy model, I developed two scalable patterns that
        seamlessly integrated sustainability messaging across multiple user
        touchpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        These enhancements accommodate varying content levels, from one to six
        key sustainability facts, ensuring flexibility for product pages,
        end-of-life notices, and marketing collateral. By aligning with the
        broader design system framework and working with the design system team,
        the patterns maintain consistency within the system while amplifying
        environmental storytelling.

        In order to measure power accurately, standardization is key. Several
        <a href="talking-same-power-language.pdf">white papers</a> were released
        to support the our efforts to accurately measure product power. Cisco is
        leading these standardization efforts across the information and
