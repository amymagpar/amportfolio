                            For example,  UX research teams are seperate from design teams, and marketing teams create user journeys that are not made in collaboration with UX. 
                            Important messaging about sustainability and products was missing.

                            I work collaboratively with engineers, product manager and owners, SMEs, and design. I also do a lot of stakholder managment in this role.

                        <p>Sustainability is important to Cisco's customers, but the sustainability stats and information about products might be mentioned in one place and then not exist on the product and solutions pages. 
                            As UX Lead on the sustaiunability team, I was asked to present two approaches to the team. 
                            The first approach would involve an effort from all teams to consistently place messaging in a certain location on product and sustainability pages so customers know exactly where to look for this information. This would need to be added to the design system annotations.
                        The second approach would use a current pattern that is very scalable to include 1 to 6 facts or assets. The downside of this approach is that it can be placed in many places on the page. It is also a pattern used to support other content and does not give a unique visual distinction except for the image on the left of the pattern. </p>

                        <p> Cisco is competing in a very fast-paced technology sector. It needs to show it is future ready and forward thinking. One way to do this is to incorporate AI into products and spaces used by customers. 
                            The app marketplace is one area where we experiemented with adding AI to the discovery experience. I wrote a guide to AI tools, outlining costs and limitations.  The engineer and I did an audit of third party add-ons,  
                            avaialble Cisco AI tools, and custom development pros and cons to evaluate costs and time to launch. I led an UX exploration to show how a tool like this would work on the site and how customers would interact with it. 
                            Questions still need to be answered before investing in this feature: Are customers having trouble finding what they are looking for currently? Will this tool really help them or confuse people?

                        <p>
                            Many use cases came up over time that had not been addressed in the new design system. 
                            The system's newness also meant that many new patterns and layouts had not been tested. 
                            One major difference in the new system was the Resources were taken off of
                            the bottom of the main page of every product and solution and put into a tab where they were hidden. Resources are important to customers 
                            and they consistently visit datasheets and other technical or thought leadership information. Previously, 
                            they held top engagement on the page. In the redesign, customers were not going to the Resources as much and important content was being hidden.
                            My solution was to insert a pattern with a few resource examples towards the bottom of the page where the Resources had previously been located with a link that drove people to the Resources tab. 
                            So far, this has increased visits to this section by 23% on the pages where this pattern has been implemneted. 

                            Cisco sends out campaigns to various industries. I was task to create the strategy and data visualization of 
                            landing pages to send potential and current customers to learn more about a specific solution or market trend. 
                            many teams create these pages and they do not look like a Cisco page. In order to stay within brand, I used one to two patterns, fonts, spacing, and colors from the system. 
                            
                            These pages created an opportunity to set styles for data visualization and motion. I did some 
                            data visulaizations and motion concepts to think about adding these to the design system since they are frequently used in promotional designs. 
                            The design system has mostly white backgrounds that makes it difficult to review chunks of different information. For these pages, I used background colors for the areas where I wanted to present distinct ideas
or data.
