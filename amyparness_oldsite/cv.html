          </br>
            <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I am a UX Director with almost two decades of
              experience, I specialize in research, strategy, and design, particularly
              for global e-commerce sites, service design and B2B. One of the things
              I’m most proud of is my ability to lead teams in developing innovative
              and intuitive designs that prioritize user needs. My passion for data
              and data visualization has led me to continuously learn and improve my
              analytical skills. I am currently pursuing a certification to enhance my
              knowledge of tools like Tableau, MySQL, and Excel.</p>
