      I led a cross-functional Global sustainability team task to raise
      awareness and meet Cisco’s goal to be a leader in the networking industry.
      I saw several big problems, a lack of data and awareness, and ESG-focused
      RFP bottlenecks. I saw an opportunity for Cisco to
      <strong
        >increase revenue by winning more enterprise deals, and strengthen its
        brand reputation</strong
      >
      by positioning itself as the
      <strong>leader in sustainable networking solutions.</strong>

      <strong>Reduced RFP Response Times</strong><br />
      Response times dropped from weeks to days or hours.<br />
      <strong>Positioning Sustainability as a core strategy</strong><br />
      By making applicable customer-facing information visible and creating
      thought leadership content, Cisco was poised to become a
      <strong>leader in power reporting &amp; sustainable networking</strong
      >.<br />
      <strong>Environmental Education</strong><br />
      Sales teams reported higher confidence in discussing sustainability
      data.<br />
      <strong>Customer Awareness</strong><br />
      Awareness of end-of-life programs rose from 20% to 55%.<br />
      <strong>6 teams</strong><br />
      Cross-functional alignment between engineering, sustainability, product
      marketing, product, UXR, and sales on the value and positioning of
      sustainability.<br />
      (insert screenshot img)<br />
      Set-up<br />
      It started with the introduction of several new
      <strong>sustainability-focused data center products</strong>. Our tiger
      team was tasked to add customer-facing information about their
      sustainability and benefits but were given only marketing-focused copy.<br />
      Digging into user research revealed a troubling gap:
      <strong
        >only 20% of customers and internal teams knew where to find
        sustainability data or were aware of Cisco’s end-of-life
        programs.</strong
      >
      For a company committed to environmental responsibility, this wasn’t just
      an information gap—it was a missed opportunity.<br />
      Timeframe: 10 months

      I created a sustainability cohort in our analytics tools to analyze user
      journeys and opportunities. Working with UXR, I analyzed previous user
      interviews and determined subjects for research at upcoming Cisco Live
      events.<br />

    <h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
    <p>
      Information Architecture Issues<br />
      Our sustainability data was trapped in silos, buried in engineering
      dashboards, and scattered across different assets. Fragmented information
      placements and the absence of applicable energy information hindered user
      engagement.<br />
      Streamline Process Bottlenecks<br />
      Manual data extraction takes 2-3 weeks, multiple approval layers slowed
      response time, and a lack of standardized measurement metrics.<br />
      Address Gaps in Content<br />
      We lacked top-of-funnel sustainability content like Thought Leadership and
      infographics to educate customers. Middle-of-funnel content like
      Cisco-verified design guides needed to be created, and bottom-of-funnel
      content like energy use product-specific information, end-of-life
      programs, and comparisons between products and competitors needed to be
      designed.<br />
      Show, Don’t Tell<br />
      Instead of treating sustainability as a separate initiative, we needed to
      integrate it into every applicable product’s story.<br />
      Empower Sales, Marketing, and Customers<br />
      Educate teams and customers to choose more sustainable products and
      solutions. Raise awareness of End-of-life programs and discounts.

    <h1 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Positioning and Monetization</strong><br />
      Transform sustainable solutions into key features in the sales funnel.
      Energy certifications and data points could be integrated into product
      pages, marketing materials, and user interfaces to drive new revenue from
      enterprise customers seeking savings and ESG compliance. New opportunities
      to promote
      <strong
        >premium sustainable products, consulting services, and
        compliance-driven upsells</strong
      >
      now have a framework.<br />
      <strong>AI for scalability</strong><br />
      The AI-powered sustainability data extraction tool would reduce RFP
      response times, enable Cisco to scale its sustainability offerings, and
      unlock new cost-saving opportunities for customers.<br />
      <strong>Content strategy</strong><br />
      Cisco can create thought leadership articles, standardize energy
      measurement, and create data center design and best practice guides to
      empower customers to make informed decisions and take actionable steps
      toward building more sustainable data centers and network infrastructures.

      During stakeholder interviews, a product engineering sustainability
      manager shared a story that crystallized our challenge:<br />
      “I have two RFPs from sales due in 48 hours requiring power usage metrics
      for our networking solutions. I spent a day trying to find if we have this
      data, only to discover it would take weeks to compile. We will lose the
      bids.”<br />
      A product dashboard existed for engineers and industrial designers to
      input attributes from manufacturing and testing while designing products.
      The dashboard has the potential to be leveraged by other teams to surface
      the customer-facing sustainability information needed to make better
      product decisions and guide purchases. In place of a redesign, I created
      an AI proof of concept to help teams extract and format sustainability
      data from the complex product database.<br />
      As one product manager noted,<br />
      <strong>“What used to take weeks now could take minutes.”</strong>

      Being able to compare products was a key need for sales, customers, and
      partners. Guiding sales and marketing to promote more efficient products
      and product teams could see areas for innovation.

      To measure power accurately, standardization is key. Several
      <a
        href="https://amp.sparklelabs.com/projects/sustainability/talking-same-power-language.pdf"
        >white papers</a
      >
      were released to support our efforts to measure product power accurately.
      Cisco is leading these standardization efforts across the information and
      communications technology (ICT) industry.<br />
      <strong>Marketing sustainability with visuals</strong><br />
      Using graphics and photographs that support renewable energy and circular
      economy ideas strengthens Cisco’s commitments and differentiation in the
      marketplace.

    <h1 id="outcomes-learnings">Outcomes &amp; Learnings</h1>
    <p>
      The key insight wasn’t just about making data accessible—it was about
      making sustainability visible at every touchpoint where it mattered. By
      integrating environmental impact information into existing workflows and
      user journeys, we turned sustainability from an afterthought into a
      competitive differentiator.<br />
      This project taught us that sometimes the most impactful UX solutions
      aren’t about creating new features—they’re about surfacing hidden value in
      ways that naturally align with user needs.
