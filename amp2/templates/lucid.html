    <h1>The Vision</h1>
    <p>
      Electric vehicles represent a transformative shift in the automotive industry, not only in terms of technology but also in how customers engage with their vehicles. Lucid Motors recognizes that an informed and engaged customer is more likely to appreciate and fully utilize the advanced features of their EV. Therefore, the customer portal was envisioned as a comprehensive, user-centered digital platform that would cater to the unique needs and questions of EV owners at each stage of their journey.
