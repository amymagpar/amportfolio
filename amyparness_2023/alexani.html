            <p>
              In the beginning of the project, I collaborated with Blue Acorn, the e-commerce consulting firm. They had presented their findings to Alex + Ani. I was asked to do my own heuristic evaluation and present it to the team. I found several key areas where I felt we could get the most impact: Charity by Design (philanthropic pieces), shopping by meanings and symbols, product care and warranty.

              My job was to show Carolyn’s vision of the Alex and Ani
              brand. “They are unique statements that speak volumes
              about those who wear them. They are symbols marking
              individual paths of life.”
              I focused on shopping by meaning and symbols while
              giving more information on the history of the meaning or
              symbol. Videos were added in product images and on landing pages to increase SEO and movement on
              the site. I lead the content strategy for Care and warranty, the gift guide and how to wear promo/tutorials.
              We designed a Create your own chain/look features to allow users to create their own unique piece while purchasing more items.

              When I started working with Alex + Ani, <i>Charity by Design</i>, where they create designs that give 20% to that particular charity, was not
              prominent on the site. It had raised 30 million at the time I started working with them. When the company changed management in
              2018, Charity by Design had raised 500 million USD.
            </p>
            I made <i>Charity by Design</i> a distinct sub-brand, with a separate voice, tag line, logo, look and feel, blog, etc. The section was added to the main navigation and items on PLPs and PDPs had a CBD badge. The Charity by Design page had a dynamic editorial-style blog with real stories, in place of a summary about philanthropy. During checkout, we used this
            space to show the charities to people who have not noticed them as add-ons. Customers became philanthropists.
