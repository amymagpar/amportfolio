description:

<p>
My journey with <em>Lucid Motors</em> centered on creating a seamless, informative, and engaging customer dashboard designed to <strong>educate</strong> and <strong>support</strong> users at every stage of their ownership journeyâ€” from the initial design phase, through the anticipation of delivery, and into their experiences as both new and seasoned owners.

challenges:

Two very large e-commerce sites needed to be redesigned to make them more modern and user-friendly without losing much revenue. How to prioritize what to improve and what can wait for post launch? 
---
goals: Replatform two highly trafficked sites with the least impact. Create user-friendly ADA-compliant responsive designs for both e-commerce sites.
---
role: UX Manager- Design management governance. Managed a team of UX/UI designers and off shore front-end development. Worked collaboratively with Product Managers.
---
solutions:

Used a LeanUX process to prioritize designs. My team worked directly with the off-shore dev team and business-side PMs in order to focus tasks and improve the process. UX took a collaborative role instead of just delivering every few weeks. Created an ADA compliant Design System.
