            <p>
              State Farm began to use AI to better serve its customers. Things that impact customer satisfaction like filing a claim and billing needed to be painless and transparent. We made these tasks automated with options to chat with an agent. These tasks were brought out on the homepage and made front and center in the auto insurance section. The self-service experiences on the .com decreased support costs by 30%.

            <p>
              Telematics use GPS and on-board diagnostics to provide insurance companies with actionable
              insights to more accurately assess risk, price
              premiums, service claims and reduce fraud. Telematics was just beginning to be used to rate insurers and give discounts. It was my job to figure out how to present this new opportunity in a customer-friendly way.
              Although it does have a better business strategy than using one's credit scores to determine rate, it does have a lot of negative privacy implications for the customer. To solve this, we offered an easier opt-in and a 50% discount at first.
