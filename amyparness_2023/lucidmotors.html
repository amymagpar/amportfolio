Many APIs needed to add some of the important portal information and functionality would not be ready in time for launch.

                        <p>We had to sell through the idea that the portal was not just for owners, it gives us the opportunity to convert designs to reservations. We wanted to design a portal that would evolve depending on where you were in the ownership process. The customer experience has many touchpints: the showroom, the .com and the app. We took a systematic approach and pitched a big picture experience to the key stakeholders which meant adding pages and functionality to the .com and to Salesforce.

                Content needed to be specific for the type of user while highlighting the luxurious materials and high-tech vehicle details. I scrubbed the owners' manual, .com, email marketing, studio print collateral, and reviewed notes from my demos with showroom salespeople. I created a content matrix for the copywriters to write and amass interesting seasonal and personalized content. Since we were short on time, we tried to reuse as much content as possible from manuals and the car interface.

            <p>A new owner's Quickstart guide was suggested with an audio playlist that took advantage of the hi-fi surround car audio.

                The time pressure of a launch limited our response, but we were able to make a meaningful impact for when the first round of vehicles were delivered. The EV space is exciting and it is the future. The adoption of electric vehicles has been slower than expected. Conversion has to do with how the charging and the ownership experience is presented from the showroom to the portals.
