      <p class="mb-12">
        Bokksu needed to reach a valuation of 100M by the end of the year. In
        addition to needing an increase in new customers, Bokksu needed to
        greatly increase customer retention. I led the product team research and
        worked with C-suite managers to ruthlessly prioritize a roadmap to
        achieve their goal.

      <h1 class="">Who are our real customers?</h1>
      <p class="mb-12">
        Initially, Bokksu's influencer partnerships generated high sales
        volumes, but an alarming 80% churn rate prompted a shift towards deeper
        customer insights. Through comprehensive surveys, interviews, and cohort
        analysis utilizing tools like Google Analytics, Little Data, Tresl,
        Yotpo, and Gorgias, we unearthed critical psychographic data beyond
        demographics. This informed the creation of detailed personas and user
        journey maps, revealing significant international customer segments and
        income distributions previously overlooked.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Bokksu had GA but we needed to be able to see the information in a
          more customized view. We created dashboards in Data Studio to make our
          analysis easier. Our dashboards allowed us to see things like Time of
          Day customers are the most responsive to conversion rates by country.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We began by synthesizing all of the big data using Google Analytics
          with Little Data, Tresl, Yotpo and Gorgias. I created cohorts based on
          the larger data view to narrow down our pool and give us the ability
          to see impact of our efforts on specific customers.

        <h1>Creating Three New Personas</h1>
        <p class="">
          Creating new personas was essential to help all teams stay aligned. A
          better understanding of emerging customer segments allows Bokksu to
          tailor products and services to meet specific user needs and gain
          deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences. These new
          personas helped create a competitive advantage, exposing new
          opportunities like personalized marketing strategies, improved
          experience for loyal subscribers, and elevating the gifting
          experience. This approach also helped inform geographic and
          demographic expansions, ensuring continued relevance and success as
          seen in their acquisition of Japan Crate in 2023.
