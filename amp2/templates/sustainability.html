    <h1>Scalable Pattern Integration</h1>
    <p><em>A lifecycle program pattern</em> I designed is being used on hardware product pages and in end-of-life notices to raise awareness of Cisco's commitments to the environment and a circular economy model.</p>
    <p>Recognizing the need for a versatile approach, I implemented a scalable pattern that could accommodate between one and six key sustainability facts. This pattern was seamlessly integrated into various touch points, from product pages to marketing collateral, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
    <p>
    </p>
    By working with the design team, I created visually distinct elements that highlighted sustainability features, which led to a more informed and empowered customer base. The scalable nature of this pattern allowed for consistent application across different product lines without compromising user experience.</p>
