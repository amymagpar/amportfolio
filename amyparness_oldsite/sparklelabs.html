              Sparkle Labs' grew out of a sketchbook full of interactive toy ideas and prototypes created during graduate school.
              We started by pitching our ideas and inventing products for toy companies like Mattel, KidRobot, and Hasbro. After writing a few articles for Make Magazine, we realized readers did not understand the basics of electronics. We decided to create a hands-on user-friendly course in a box. </p>

            <p>We now have seven kits that teach both kids and adults how to prototype and understand electronics. Working with electronic circuits grows problem-solving skills, enables the ability to prototype your own ideas and repair the electronics that surround us.</p>

            <p>
              This is our flagship kit and the beginning of it all. We made the first kits by hand and once demand was great enough, we went to China to meet manufacturers. This has been a learning process where now we have a partnership with our factory.

            <p>From the beginning, we worked to make the packaging sustainable and free of plastics. The Discover Electronics kit is in its third version. From surveys and feedback from educators and owners of the kit, we learned that some of them buy plastic containers to store the parts. In the third version, we totally redesigned the packaging to make the kit itself a storage containers made out of pulp paper waste.</p>

            <p>
              I created the SunMod from a Make Magazine article I wrote. I had hacked my TV remote that kept running out of batteries and wrote a how-to article.
              I had the product manufactured and it is still one of our top selling kits. It is used in schools to teach Green Energy and by people who want to save money on batteries.

            <p>
              Papertronics are a line of electronic paper toys. I led the Product Design for both volumes. Our first release was Papertronics - Lunar Landers Vol 1. This kit comes in a pack of three. One is blank and you can design it yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second release came with glue dots so customers could make them right out of the package.
            </p>
            <p>
              We promoted these by having well-known artists create their own Lunar Landers for an exhibition.

        <h3>UV Skulls</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, we released a <i>Day of the Dead</i> Papertronic, UV Skulls. UV Skulls have glow in the dark ink and UV lights. We designed stencils with popular <i>Day of the Dead</i> illustrations so it would be easy to make your own calavera in the traditional Mexican style.
