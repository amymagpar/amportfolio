              At <em>Cisco</em>, fragmented sustainability data and poor
              information architecture were causing lost sales opportunities,
              with only 20% of customers aware of
              <strong>end-of-life</strong> programs and
              <strong>climate-focused</strong> RFP response times stretching to
              3+ weeks.

              Leading a cross-functional UX initiative across six departments,
              My team and I transformed how and what kind of
              <strong>sustainability</strong> data surfaced throughout the
              product lifecycle. Using an <strong>AI POC</strong>, I could
              decrease RFP response times from weeks to days or hours, customer
              awareness of end-of-life programs rose from 20% to 75%, and
              <strong>sustainability content engagement</strong> increased by
              200%.

            <p class="prose leading-snug">
              The initiative demonstrated how strategic UX leadership could turn
              sustainability from a compliance requirement into a competitive
              advantage by making
              <strong>environmental impact data</strong> visible and accessible
              at every key decision point.

                It started with the introduction of several new <strong>sustainability-focused data center products</strong>. Our tiger team was tasked to add customer-facing information about their sustainability and benefits but were given only marketing-focused copy. Digging into user research revealed a troubling gap: <strong>only 20% of customers and internal teams knew where to find sustainability data or were aware of Cisco’s end-of-life programs.</strong> For a company committed to environmental responsibility, this wasn’t just an information gap—it was a missed opportunity for impact.

              <h2 class="uppercase mb-2">Key Insights</h2>
                <h3>Information Architecture Issues</h3>
                  <p>Our sustainabipty data was trapped in silos, buried in engineering dashboards, and scattered across different assets. Fragmented information placements and the absence of apppcable energy information hindered user engagement.</p>

                  <h3>Streamline Process Bottlenecks</h3>
                  <p>Manual data extraction takes 2-3 weeks, had multiple approval layers slowing response time and a lack of standardized sustainabipty metrics</p>

                <h3>Address Gaps in Content</h3>
                <p>
                    We lacked top-of-funnel sustainability content like Thought Leadership and infographics to educate customers.
                    Middle-of-funnel content like Cisco-verified design guides needed to be created, and bottom-of-funnel content like energy use product-specific information and comparisons between products and competitors was not easily accessible.
                  </p>

                <h3>Surface Sustainability Information</h3>
                <p>on purpose pages, while engaging Press and people researching Cisco, failed to drive users to product and solution pages, necessitating a strategic overhaul.</p>

                <h3>Show, Don't Tell</h3>
                  <p>Instead of treating sustainability as a separate initiative, we needed to integrate it into every product story.</p>

                <h3>Empower Sales, Marketing, and Customers</h3>
                <p>with the information they need to choose more sustainable products and solutions. Give customers, partners, and other teams the information on proper disposal of End of Life products.</p>

          The product dashboard needed to be overhauled to be used by other teams to extract power and material information. In lieu of a redesign, I created an AI assistant proof of concept to help teams quickly extract and format sustainability data from the complex product database. As one product manager noted, "What used to take weeks now could take minutes."

          <h1>Elevating sustainability through design system innovation</h1>
          <p>
            To support Cisco's environmental commitments, RFPs, and advance the
            circular economy model, I developed two scalable patterns that
            seamlessly integrated sustainability messaging across multiple user
            touchpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            These enhancements accommodate varying content levels, from one to
            six key sustainability facts, ensuring flexibility for product
            pages, end-of-life notices, and marketing collateral. By aligning
            with the broader design system framework and working with the design
            system team, the patterns maintain consistency within the system
            while amplifying environmental storytelling.
